# Spring-Boot-Event-Booking-Application

## Introduction
Welcome to the Java Spring Boot Event Booking web application project! I wanted to start this project to personally demonstrate my ability to use Java Spring Boot to build a simple event booking web application.  The project consists of a fully functional web application that allows users to view upcoming events, create new events, and book tickets for those events. The application is built using Java Spring Boot, which is a popular framework for building enterprise web applications.  Throughout the project, I hope to demonstrate my grasp on fundamental concepts of Spring Boot, including building controllers, views, and models. I will also handle user authentication and authorization, validate user input, and persist data using a relational database.  This project is intended to be a showcase my abilities as a junior developer. I will demonstrate my understanding of Java Spring Boot by building a well-structured, maintainable, and scalable web application that adheres to industry best practices. 

## Project Requirements for Simple Spring Boot Web Application for Event Registration:

**User Registration:**
Users should be able to register by providing their basic information (name, email, password).
User registration should be validated to ensure that all required fields are filled and that the email is unique.

**User Authentication:** 
Users should be able to log in using their email and password.
Passwords should be encrypted and stored securely.

**Event Creation:** Authenticated users should be able to create events by providing event details (title, description, date/time, location).
Event creation should be validated to ensure that all required fields are filled.

**Event Booking:**
Authenticated users should be able to book events.
Users should be able to see a list of events and select an event to book.
Users should be able to select the number of tickets they want to purchase.
Event booking should be validated to ensure that the requested number of tickets is available.

**Event Management:** 
Event creators should be able to manage their events (edit, delete).
Event deletion should prompt the user for confirmation before deleting.

**Displaying Event Details:** Users should be able to view event details such as title, description, date/time, location, and available tickets.

**Pagination:** Events should be paginated to improve performance and user experience.

**Error Handling:** The application should handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to the user.

**User Dashboard:** Authenticated users should be able to view a dashboard showing their upcoming events and tickets.

**Deployment:** The application should be deployable to a cloud platform like Heroku or AWS.
These project requirements are simple enough for a junior developer to implement and will showcase their ability to create a basic Spring Boot web application for event registration. Good luck with your project!
