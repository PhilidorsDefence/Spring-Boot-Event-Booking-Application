# Spring-Boot-Event-Booking-Application

Welcome to the Java Spring Boot Event Booking web application project! I wanted to start this project to personally demonstrate my ability to use Java Spring Boot to build a simple event booking web application.  The project consists of a fully functional web application that allows users to view upcoming events, create new events, and book tickets for those events. The application is built using Java Spring Boot, which is a popular framework for building enterprise web applications.  Throughout the project, I hope to demonstrate my grasp on fundamental concepts of Spring Boot, including building controllers, views, and models. I will also handle user authentication and authorization, validate user input, and persist data using a relational database.  This project is intended to be a showcase my abilities as a junior developer. I will demonstrate my understanding of Java Spring Boot by building a well-structured, maintainable, and scalable web application that adheres to industry best practices.
